# Customer-Behaviour-analysis

To explain how I would analyze a dataset containing customer behavior data for a popular online streaming service, I will use Spotify as my example and walk through the procedure.

I will follow the CRISP-DM methodology for this streaming service data analysis project. This approach will ensure a structured analysis of the dataset. Here's how I'll proceed through each phase:

## 1. Business Understanding:
I'll start by clarifying the business objectives. The main goals are to uncover insights that could inform business decisions, focusing on user engagement, content preferences, churn prediction, and revenue optimization for the streaming service.

## 2. Data Understanding:
I'll begin exploring the dataset, which includes variables such as 'Age', 'Gender', 'spotify_usage_period', 'spotify_listening_device', 'spotify_subscription_plan', 'premium_sub_willingness', 'preffered_premium_plan', 'preferred_listening_content', 'fav_music_genre', 'music_time_slot', 'music_Influencial_mood', 'music_lis_frequency', 'music_expl_method', 'music_recc_rating', 'pod_lis_frequency', 'fav_pod_genre', 'preffered_pod_format', 'pod_host_preference', 'preffered_pod_duration', and 'pod_variety_satisfaction'.

I'll use Python with pandas to load the data and perform initial statistical analyses. I'll create visualizations to understand the distribution and relationships of variables:

- Histograms for 'Age' and 'music_recc_rating'
- Bar charts for 'Gender', 'spotify_subscription_plan', and 'fav_music_genre'
- Pie charts for 'spotify_listening_device' and 'preferred_listening_content'
- Box plots to show the relationship between 'Age' and 'music_lis_frequency'

## 3. Data Preparation:
I'll clean the data, handling any missing values or inconsistencies. I'll encode categorical variables like 'Gender' and 'spotify_subscription_plan' using one-hot encoding or label encoding. I'll create derived variables if needed, such as grouping 'Age' into categories.

## 4. Modeling:
For this phase, I'll use several modeling techniques:

### User Engagement
To analyze user engagement, I'll look at the relationship between 'spotify_usage_period' and 'music_lis_frequency' using a box plot. Additionally, I'll examine how 'music_Influencial_mood' relates to 'music_time_slot' using a heatmap.

### Churn Prediction
To predict churn, I'll build a logistic regression model using scikit-learn. The target variable will be 'premium_sub_willingness', and I'll use features like 'Age', 'spotify_usage_period', 'music_recc_rating', and 'pod_variety_satisfaction'. I'll evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the ROC curve.

### User Segmentation
I'll apply K-means clustering to segment users based on features like 'Age', 'music_lis_frequency', 'pod_lis_frequency', and 'music_recc_rating'. I'll visualize the clusters using a scatter plot, with 'Age' on one axis and 'music_lis_frequency' on the other, color-coded by cluster.

### Revenue Optimization
To optimize revenue, I'll analyze the distribution of 'preferred_premium_plan' using a treemap and use a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between 'music_recc_rating' and 'premium_sub_willingness'.

### Decision Tree for Content Preferences
I'll use a decision tree classifier to understand the factors influencing 'preferred_premium_plan' choice. Visualizing the tree structure will help identify the most important factors in premium plan selection.

## 5. Evaluation
I'll assess the performance and usefulness of each model:

- For the churn prediction model, I'll use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- For clustering, I'll use the silhouette score to evaluate cluster quality.
- For the decision tree, I'll examine the feature importance to understand key factors influencing content preferences.

I'll also validate the models against the business objectives, ensuring they provide actionable insights for user engagement, content preferences, churn prediction, and revenue optimization.

## 6. Deployment
While I won't be deploying the models into a production environment, I'll focus on presenting the results in a clear, actionable manner:

- I'll create an interactive dashboard using Tableau or Power BI, showcasing key metrics and allowing stakeholders to explore the data.
- I'll prepare a detailed report summarizing the findings, including visualizations and recommendations for business strategy.
- I'll suggest ways to implement the insights, such as personalized content recommendations based on user segments or targeted retention strategies for users likely to churn.

Throughout this process, I'll use various visualization techniques including heatmaps, treemaps, and sunburst charts to present complex relationships in the data. I'll also ensure that each step of the CRISP-DM process is documented, allowing for easy review and iteration if needed.

By following this CRISP-DM methodology, I'll ensure a thorough, systematic approach to analyzing the streaming service data, providing valuable insights to inform business decisions and strategy.
